# ESP8266 Radiation Pattern Project
This project is a radiation model created using the ESP8266 WiFi module and A4988 motor driver. The project includes a system that can be controlled remotely via WiFi connection and reads radiation data via the IoT platform called Thingspeak.

## Requirements
The following components are needed for the project to work:

- ESP8266 WiFi module
- A4988 motor driver
- radiation sensor
- Arduino IDE or similar development environment

## Setup
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Download or clone the project from GitHub repository: GitHub Project Repository
3. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the source code of the project.
4. Make the connections of the ESP8266 WiFi module and load the necessary libraries.
5. Create Thingspeak account and get API key.
6. Upload the project to the ESP8266 via the Arduino IDE.
7. Connect the motor driver and radiation sensor correctly.
8. Run the project and monitor the radiation data via Thingspeak.
